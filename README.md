This is my personal portfolio site, built from scratch with HTML, SCSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this project was to build a complete website and create a home for my web development projects.

While it isn't meant to be forked, since this site is tailored for my own needs, feel free to use anything useful you find within the site template for your own projects.
